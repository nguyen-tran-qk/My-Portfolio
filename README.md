# My Portfolio
A one-page portfolio introducing about myself: basic infos, my (future) projects, contactsâ€¦

In this portfolio, I used some frameworks: [fullpage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js), [fakeLoader.js](https://github.com/joaopereirawd/fakeLoader.js).

In #My-Projects section, I have only added the first 2 other simple projects of mine (including this one, the other is [here](https://github.com/nguyenkevtran/Vungtau-Tour_with_ParallaxScrolling-Bootstrap)). I'm hoping to add many more in the future. For now I'll just leave some beautiful images there.
